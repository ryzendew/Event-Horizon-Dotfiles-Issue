# Event Horizon Dotfiles

My personal desktop environment setup for Linux, built on Hyprland and Quickshell. It's basically a complete desktop experience that I've been tweaking and refining over time.

## What is this?

This started as [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) dotfiles but has grown into my own full desktop environment setup. I'm using Hyprland as the window manager (it's a tiling Wayland compositor) and Quickshell for the shell/widget system. Together they make for a pretty solid desktop experience.

## License

This was originally inspired by [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell), but I've rewritten everything and it's no longer a fork. The design keeps changing as I tweak things.

Do whatever you want with it. Fork it, modify it, use parts of it - I don't care about attribution.
